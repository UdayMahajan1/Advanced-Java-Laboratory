1. First checkout this branch using **git checkout lab6** and then start working, or else you won't get the project specific code. 
2. New classes are to be created in the com.springcore package (you are free to experiment though, you may try creating additional packages for particular files and then reference them in the main App file)
3. The App class file is the main file which executes your code. If you want to use the beans that you've created, it'll house the code for it. Run this file and check the terminal in your IDE verify the output.
4. The default path in Maven project structure is considered to be in the resources package, thus it houses the config.xml file. Use this file to define the beans in using XML Configuration.
